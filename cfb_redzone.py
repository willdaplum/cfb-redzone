cfb_redzone.py - Proof of concept:
- Launches Chrome user-data dirs (one per service)
- Opens game pages for chosen games
- Polls ESPN scoreboard/play-by-play JSON and brings red-zone games forward

Notes:
- Customize SERVICE_URL_TEMPLATES to map service -> URL pattern for a game
- ESPN JSON endpoints are used here as an example. You may need to adapt parsing for other sources.
